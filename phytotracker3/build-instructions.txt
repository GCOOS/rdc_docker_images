Note:

If making changes ONLY to the base image, you can just build and push.
If we've maded changes to phytotracker3 (in phytotracker3_dev) we need
to rm the existing src folder and copy the new. Then we remove the .git from
the new src folder.  Then, and only then, can we build. This will get the
lastest phytotracker3 into the image.
