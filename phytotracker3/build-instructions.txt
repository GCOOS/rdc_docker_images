Note:

If making changes ONLY to the base image, you can just build and push.
If we've maded changes to phytotracker3 (in phytotracker3_dev) we need
to rm the existing src folder and copy the new. Then we remove the .git from
the new src folder.  Then, and only then, can we build. This will get the
lastest phytotracker3 into the image.

We removed the phytotracker3 source tree. Going back to using volume mounts
in hsv3. We added a compile for OpenCV here, so we can write using avc1/h264 
which requires a source compile. The pip-installed opencv does not support
avc1 and thus requires ffmpeg, which made for a really convoluted process.
